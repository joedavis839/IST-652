Scripting for Data Science
This was my first Python project, I decided to take a look at a movie review dataset. The dataset is from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset . In this analysis, the data was imported, cleaned, and 
descriptive statistics were performed to get an idea about the data. As this was my first Python project, no heavy machine
learning was performed, instead simple descriptive statistics and visualizations were performed.
